Abstract out Enemy class so you can make different types of enemies.
Make Enemies move on their own.
Make Obstacles
Collision detection callbacks
Need to update Fall method in Player to stop falling when a collision is detected on bottom
May need to tweak PLAYER_JUMP_SPEED to allow for higher jumps.
Player stats/skills: will need to pull out alot of definitions into separate class so we can allow player to tweak them.
Need to change movement updates to allow for different size screens
     (i.e. use screen.width for movement updates like you did in jump)
