Implement Shooting
  - Projectile isn't deleting properly
Make Obstacles
Collision detection callbacks

Need to update Fall method in Player to stop falling when a collision is detected on bottom
May need to tweak PLAYER_JUMP_SPEED to allow for higher jumps.
Player stats/skills: will need to pull out alot of definitions into separate class so we can allow player to tweak them.
